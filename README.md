# Mister-FAU Discord Bot based on FAU GenAI Lab Owlmind


## Solution Overview
This is a prototype solution for a Generative AI powered student support bot known as “Mister-FAU”.

The proposed solution is a personalized, university-specialized generative AI chatbot designed to provide academic, career, administrative, and social support to students directly through Discord. It leverages a modular pipeline architecture that integrates natural language understanding, dynamic data retrieval from university systems, secure user profiling, and context-aware LLM responses to create an always-on, adaptive support system. Prioritizing user privacy, emotional intelligence, and operational scalability, this bot is built to significantly reduce human advising load while delivering a higher standard of communication, precision, and engagement than traditional university support services.

## Note

This prototype was developed for Dr. Fernando Koch's graduate course, Generative AI and Software Development Lifecycles, and was created using Generative AI tools as much as possible. 

The repository utilizes Python code adopted from Dr. Fernando Koch's Owlmind: https://github.com/genilab/owlmind/tree/main
