# Mister-FAU Discord Bot based on FAU GenAI Lab Owlmind

This repository utilizes Python code adopted from Dr. Fernando Koch's Owlmind: https://github.com/genilab/owlmind/tree/main


#### Solution Overview
This is a prototype solution for a Generative AI powered student support bot known as “Mister-FAU”.

The proposed solution is a personalized, university-specialized generative AI chatbot designed to provide academic, career, administrative, and social support to students directly through Discord. It leverages a modular pipeline architecture that integrates natural language understanding, dynamic data retrieval from university systems, secure user profiling, and context-aware LLM responses to create an always-on, adaptive support system. Prioritizing user privacy, emotional intelligence, and operational scalability, this bot is built to significantly reduce human advising load while delivering a higher standard of communication, precision, and engagement than traditional university support services.
